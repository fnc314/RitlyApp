Week3_MiniProject
=================

MiniProject from Week 3 at GA_WDI
==

A variant of Bitly, meant to demonstrate a simple Rails app with a small database. Users submit a URL and receive a simple code that represents their URL. The user can then view their entire collection of codes and their associated web address. Also, using the code and/or a link generated by the app, users can navigate from this app to the web address initially entered.

One of the first Rails apps ever generated
